# Codingame Projects

This repository contains solutions tailored for the [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/) platform. You'll notice some quirks in the code, such as:

- **Auto-generated comments**: These help format the code for Codingame’s single-file requirements.
- **Extensive use of `stderr`**: All debug messages are sent to `stderr` to avoid interfering with the required `stdout` output.
- **Strict adherence to input/output rules**: Codingame only supports `stdin` for input and `stdout` for puzzle solutions.

These adjustments ensure compatibility with Codingame’s execution environment. Enjoy exploring the puzzles!
